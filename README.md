# Candy-Crush---MASM16
Candy Crush game in assembly language (MASM 16).
Using visuals interrupts, we created our front end and then using those dynamic shapes, we moved them and formed the backend which took care of combinations and such areas.
The player enters their name and then they go through 3 different levels where they have to form combinations to pop candies and get score.
After getting a certain score they can pass a level and upon passing all three levels, they complete the game and get their total which is also recorded in a txt file.
All implemented in masm16 and run on dosbox emulator.
